# MyStore

MyStore is Angular application that allows users to view a list of available products to purchase, add them to a shopping cart, and ultimately complete the checkout process.

## Pre-requisites

3. After the backend is running we can continue to run the current angular application.

2. To install the dependencies run command - [npm install].
3. To start the server run command [ng serve].
