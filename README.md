# MyStore

MyStore is Angular application that allows users to view a list of available products to purchase, add them to a shopping cart, and ultimately complete the checkout process.
The application reflects the same user experience as that of a real-world e-commerce website, including :

`Product list` It displays the available products for the user to choose and add to their cart (in various quantities)
`Product details` It displays more information about any particular product
`Shopping cart` It includes the products that the user has added to their cart
`Checkout form` It collects information about the user (e.g., name, address, payment details, etc.)
`Order confirmation` It shows the outcome after the user completes the checkout process (i.e., submits the checkout form)

## Pre-requisites

For the angular frontend to run properly you first need to run the backend server using following steps:
1. Download or clone the repository https://github.com/adityadahiya/Storefront-Backend.git.
2. Follow the steps given in Readme.md to run the backend server. There is no need to run the test commands.
3. After the backend is running we can continue to run the current angular application.

### Installation

1. Clone or download this repository and change directory (cd) to the root of the repository.
2. To install the dependencies run command - [npm install].
3. To start the server run command [ng serve].
4. In the browser navigate to url: `http://localhost:4200/`

`Note:` If you don't have angular cli installed then install it using the command: [npm install -g @angular/cli]

#### Running Ports

After start up, the backend server will start on port 3000 and the frontend angular application will be running on port 4200.
